### Hi, I'm Michal.

I build software for lexicography and the humanities. I like rule-based language technology. 🤖

💻 I code in `C#` `Python` `JavaScript`, `SQL`, `XML`, `HTML`, `CSS` and [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/).  
🌐 I speak `en` `ga` `cs` well and `de` `ru` badly.
